# PalpiteBOX

This project is part of the [Devpleno](http://devpleno.com/) course and consists of a website that the client can rate the restaurant and receive a coupom for it! We mainly use [React](https://reactjs.org), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) were used to record the data from the form.
